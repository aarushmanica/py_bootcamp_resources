    <h3><u>Working with CSV Files</u></h3>
    <h4><b>Working with CSV Files</b></h4>
    <p>Let's discuss how to work with CSV files in Python. A file with the CSV file extension is a Comma Separated Value file. All CSV files are plain text, contain alphanumeric characters, and structure the data contained within them in a tabular form. Don't confuse Excel files with csv files, while csv files are formatted very similarly to excel files, they don't have data types for their values, they are all strings with no font or colour. They also don't have worksheets the way an excel file does. Python does have libraries for working with Excel files, you check them out <a href="https://www.python-excel.org/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.xlwings.org/">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Files in the CSV format are generally used to exchange data, usually when there's a large amount, between different applications. Database programs, analytical software, and other applications that store massive amounts of information (like contacts and customer data), will usually support the CSV format.</p>

    <p>Let's explore how we can open a csv file with Python's built-in csv library.</p>
    <hr>

    <h4>Notebook Locations</h4>
    <p>Run <b>pwd</b> inside a notebook cell to find out where your notebook is located.</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
        pwd
        <code>Output: /Users/aarush/Desktop/zero\ to\ hero\ python\ bootcamp\ stuff</code>
    </code></pre>
    <hr>

    <h4>Reading CSV Files</h4>
    <pre><code class="python">
        import csv
    </code></pre>

    <p>When passing in the file path, make sure to include the extension if it has one, you should be able to Tab Autocomplete the file name. If you can't Tab autocomplete that is a good indicator your file is not in the same location as your notebook. You can always type in the entire file path (it will look similar in formatting to the output of <b>pwd</b>.</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
        data = open('example.csv')
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        data
        <code>Output: &lt;_io.TextIOWrapper name='example.csv' mode='r' encoding='cp1252'&gt;</code>
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Encoding</h4>
    <p>Often csv files may contain characters that you can't interpret with standard Python, this could be something like an <b>@</b> symbol, or even foreign characters. Let's view an example of this sort of error (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9233027/unicodedecodeerror-charmap-codec-cant-decode-byte-x-in-position-y-character">it's pretty common, so it's important to go over</a>)</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
        csv_data = csv.reader(data)
    </code></pre>

    <p>Cast to a list will give an error, note the <b>can't decode</b> line in the error, this is a giveaway that we have an encoding problem!</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
        data_lines = list(csv_data)
    </code></pre>
    <code>Output: </code> <img src="afec.png" style="width:600px;">

    <p>Let's not try reading it with a "utf-8" encoding.</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
        data = open('example.csv', encoding="utf-8")
        csv_data = csv.reader(data)
        data_lines = list(csv_data)
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        # Looks like it worked!
        data_lines[:3]
        <code>Output: 
            [['id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'email', 'gender', 'ip_address', 'city'],
            ['1',
             'Joseph',
             'Zaniolini',
             'jzaniolini0@simplemachines.org',
             'Male',
             '163.168.68.132',
             'Pedro Leopoldo'],
            ['2',
             'Freida',
             'Drillingcourt',
             'fdrillingcourt1@umich.edu',
             'Female',
             '97.212.102.79',
             'Buri']]</code>
    </code></pre>

    <p>Note the first item in the list is the header line, this contains the information about what each column represents. Let's format our printing just a bit:</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
        for line in data_lines[:5]:
            print(line)
        <code>Output: 
            ['id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'email', 'gender', 'ip_address', 'city']
            ['1', 'Joseph', 'Zaniolini', 'jzaniolini0@simplemachines.org', 'Male', '163.168.68.132', 'Pedro Leopoldo']
            ['2', 'Freida', 'Drillingcourt', 'fdrillingcourt1@umich.edu', 'Female', '97.212.102.79', 'Buri']
            ['3', 'Nanni', 'Herity', 'nherity2@statcounter.com', 'Female', '145.151.178.98', 'Claver']
            ['4', 'Orazio', 'Frayling', 'ofrayling3@economist.com', 'Male', '25.199.143.143', 'Kungur']</code>
    </code></pre>

    <p>Let's imagine we wanted a list of all the emails. For demonstration, since there are 1000 items plus the header, we will only do a few rows.</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
        len(data_lines)
        <code>Output: 1001</code>
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        all_emails = []
        for line in data_lines[1:15]:
            all_emails.append(line[3])
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        print(all_emails)
        <code>Output: 
            ['jzaniolini0@simplemachines.org', 'fdrillingcourt1@umich.edu', 'nherity2@statcounter.com', 'ofrayling3@economist.com', 'jmurrison4@cbslocal.com', 'lgamet5@list-manage.com', 'dhowatt6@amazon.com', 'kherion7@amazon.com', 'chedworth8@china.com.cn', 'hgasquoine9@google.ru', 'ftarra@shareasale.com', 'abathb@umn.edu', 'lchastangc@goo.gl', 'cceried@yale.edu']</code>
    </code></pre>

    <p>What if we wanted a list of full names?</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
        full_names = []
        for line in data_lines[1:15]:
            full_names.append(line[1] + ' ' + line[2])
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        full_names
        <code>Output: 
            ['Joseph Zaniolini',
            'Freida Drillingcourt',
            'Nanni Herity',
            'Orazio Frayling',
            'Julianne Murrison',
            'Lucy Gamet',
            'Dyana Howatt',

            'Andrew Bath',
            'Lucais Chastang',
            'Car Cerie']</code>
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Writing to CSV Files</h4>
    <p>We can also write csv files, either new ones or add on to existing files.</p>

    <h4>New File</h4>
    <p><b>This will also overwrite any existing file with the same name, so be careful with this!</b></p>
    <pre><code class="python">
        # newline controls how universal newlines works (it only applies to text mode.)
        # It can be None, '', '\n', '\r' and '\r\n'.
        file_to_output = open('to_save_file.csv', 'w', newline = '')
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        csv_writer = csv.writer(file_to_output, delimiter = ',')
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        csv_writer.writerow(['a', 'b', 'c'])
        <code>Output: 7</code>
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        csv_writer.writerows([['1', '2', '3'], ['4', '5', '6']])
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        file_to_output.close()
    </code></pre>
    <hr>

    <h4>Existing File</h4>
    <pre><code class="python">
        f = open('to_save_file.csv', 'a', newline = '')
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        csv_writer = csv.writer(f)
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        csv_writer.writerow(['new', 'new', 'new'])
        <code>Output: 13</code>
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        f.close()
    </code></pre>

    <p>That is all for the basics! If you believe you will be working with CSV files often, you may want to check out the powerful <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas library</a>.</p>

    <h3><u>Working with PDFs</u></h3>
    <h4><b>Working with PDFs</b></h4>
    <p>Often you will have to deal with PDF files. There are many libraries in Python for working with PDFs, each with their pros and cons, the most common one being <b>PyPDF2</b>. You can install it with (note the case-sensitivity, you need to make sure your capitalisation matches):</p>
    <p style="font-size:17px; font-family: monospace;">&emsp;&emsp;pip install PyPDF2</p> 

    <p>Keep in mind that not every PDF file can be read with this library. PDFs that are too blurry, have a special encoding, encrypted or maybe just created with a particular program that doesn't work well with PyPDF2 won't be able to read. If you find yourself in this situation, use alternative libraries, but keep in mind, these may also not work. The reason for this is because of the many different parameters for a PDF and how non-standard the settings can be, text could be shown as an image instead of a utf-8 encoding. There are many parameters to consider in this aspect.</p>

    <p>As far as PyPDF2 is concerned, it can only read the text from a PDF doucment, it won't be able to grab images or other media files from a PDF.</p>
    <hr>

    <h4>Working with PyPDF2</h4>
    <p>Let's begin showing the basics of the PyPDF2 library.</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
        # note the capitalisation 
        import PyPDF2
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Reading PDFs</h4>
    <p>Similar to the csv library, we open a pdf, then create a reader object for it. Notice how we use the binary method of reading, 'rb', instead of just 'r'.</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
        # Notice we read it as a binary with 'rb'
        f = open('Working_Business_Proposal.pdf', 'rb')
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(f)
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        pdf_reader.numPages
        <code>Output: 5</code>
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        page_one = pdf_reader.getPage(0)
    </code></pre>

    <p>We can then extract the text:</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
        page_one_text = page_one.extractText()
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        page_one_text
        <code>Output: 'Business Proposal\n The Revolution is Coming\n Leverage agile frameworks to provide a robust synopsis for high level \noverviews.

    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        f.close()
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Adding to PDFs</h4>
    <p>We can not write to PDFs using Python because of the differences between the single string type of Python, and the variety of fonts, placements, and other parameters that a PDF could have.</p>

    <p>What we can do is copy pages and append pages to the end.</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
        f = open('Working_Business_Proposal.pdf', 'rb')
        pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(f)
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        first_page = pdf_reader.getPage(0)
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        pdf_writer = PyPDF2.PdfFileWriter()
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        pdf_writer.addPage(first_page)
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        pdf_output = open('Some_New_Doc.pdf', "wb")
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        pdf_writer.write(pdf_output)
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
        f.close()
    </code></pre>

    <p>Now we have a copied a page and added it to another new document!</p>
    <hr>

    <h4>Simple Example</h4>
    <p>Let's try to grab all the text from this PDF file:</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
        f = open('Working_Business_Proposal', 'rb')

        # List of every page's text
        # The index will correspond to the page number
        pdf_text = []

        pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(f)

        for p in range(pdf_reader.numPages):
            page = pdf_reader.getPage(p)
            pdf_text.append(page.extractText())
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code class="python">
